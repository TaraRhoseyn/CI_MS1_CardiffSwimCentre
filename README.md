## Overall Goals of the Website 

The business goals of Cardiff Swim Centre (hereinafter referred to as CSW):

- Increase sales by converting regular customers into monthly members.
- Stress CSW's unique selling point to customers: a pool for serious fitness enthusiasts and not families.
- Increase awareness of the brand as one associated with sports prestige and excellence.
- Build an intuitive UX so users return to the site for key information such as location and pool times.

The user goals:

- Find a premier swimming pool where the priority is training.
- Find a pool timetable that is instuitively built and easy to use. 
- Understand the differences between individual session pricing and membership pricing.
- Find information about facilities at the pool.
- Find out where the pool is located and parking information.

## User Experience

I have designed this website with mobile in mind by creating bite-sized easily digestible pieces of content that can be seperated easily. 

I have structured each page according to the information architecture organising principle of placing the most important content 'above the fold', then working my way down in order of priority. 

The user experience is structured around two main goals, (a) to allow the users to discover CSW's location and brand philosophy, and (b) to users convert into members. Call to actions to these goals are found throughout the website and are given priority through the colour scheme, e.g. more important call to actions are more eye-catching. For example, the navigation bar displays a "Join" button in the top of all pages.

### Target Audience

- Fitness enthusiasts
- Regular swimmers
- Competitive swimmers
- Triathletes
- Teens who participate in swimming clubs and galas
- Parents of above teens

### User Stories

I have divided my user stories into two categories: first-time users and regular visitors, with the understanding that the goal of communicating the brand philosophy and location information will be less of a priority to returning visitors.

#### First-time users

1. As a first time user, I want to know the specifications of the pools so I know it's suited to my needs as a fast or long-distance swimmer.
2. As a first time user, I want to see location information so that I can know where to go to use the pool and plan my journey.
3. As a first time user, I want to see information about classes so that I know I can improve my fitness.
4. As a first time user, I want to understand their brand values align with my own as a fitness enthusiast.
5. As a first time user, I want to locate their social media accounts so I can receive regular updates from them and see how well known they are in the world of swimming.
6. As a first time user, I want to see a timetable to ensure it works with my own schedules.
7. As a first time user, I want to know the prices of using the pool and membership.

#### Regular visitors

8. As a regular visitor, I want to see a timetable so that I can know which times I can use the pool. 
9. As a regular visitor, I want to see information about classes 
10. As a regular visitor, I want to understand the pricing model to understand if becoming a member is cost effective. 
11. As a regular visitor, I want to be able to see what the pool offers to see if there are any updates.

#### Site owner 

12. As a site owner, I want customers to be able to join as members in an easy and intuitive way directly on the website.
13. As a site owner, I want customers to be able to access our pool timetable quickly and easily to ensure they can access services at their desired time. 
14. As a site owner, I want prospective customers to be able to contact us with queries or feedback easily. 
15. As a site owner, I want customers to find information about classes in language that is plain and accessible to ensure appropriate use of training.

## Scope 

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features: 

- Navigation bar to let users navigate the website simply, with bolded text and a circle underline to show users which page they are currently on. 
- A footer across all pages with links to social media and other places on the website such as pricing and location. 
- A pool timetable with classes, lane swimming times and closed times. 
- Modal where you can join up as a member in the navigation bar of every page, making joining quick and easy. 
- Pricing page which communicates the benefits of membership clearly and explains costs simply. 
- Contact form where queries can be sent. The form is functional and will not submit unless all fields are filled out. 
- Explanation of training classes, their cost and their benefits to swimmers. 
- An error page (404.html) that directs site users back to the home page (index.html) in the event of a broken URL. 
- An About page which contains company ethos and marketing copy to entice users.
- An About page which contains clear descriptions of all facilities on offer. 
- Embedded map with a location pin to show users how to get to the pool, accompanied by parking information and opening times.
- Favicon icon to help users identify the site.


Features to be built in future releases: 

- Multi-page form to purchase membership and the ability to sign up to monthly direct debit payments. 
- Booking system for training classes. 
- The ability to toggle which days you want to view in the pool timetable on mobile view. 
- A collapsible carousel on the About page on mobile view to switch view between cards.


## Design

My overall approach to the design came from a desire to create a brand that was modern, clean, aesthetically pleasing. From a UX perspective, I also wanted a site that was easily navigable and did not cause cognitive overload. 

The visual language of the website takes it's inspiration from water, much of the components have a fluidity, softness and curviture. 

### Colour Scheme

I have created a contrasting colour scheme of blue and orange with shades of blue being the primary colour. I chose a complementary colour scheme (blue/orange) to be able to draw particular attention to key call to actions. 

I picked blue first, as this gives the user memories and associations of water. It's also a colour often associated with safety and security in marketing/branding.

### Typography

My heading font is Nunito from Google Fonts. I chose this font because:
- The soft and curvy form that goes well with the rest of the visual language
- It's a sans-serif font which is more accessible for people with dyslexia. Sans-serif is the back-up font is Nunito fails. 

My body font is Montserrat. I chose this font because of:
- Wide availability on web browsers. 
- It compliments Nunito well as it's also a largely circular and soft font, but it also contrasts enough with Nunito in terms of font weight to offer a pleasing contrast.

### Imagery

All images on the website are of professional quality and fully licensed. They usually depict swimmers in action to convey a dynamic, lively, and aspiration visual language. Please see 'Credits' section for more information on licenses.

They're striking images that give an energetic feel to the website which stands out particularly well against the white space and modern aesthetic of the overall design.
