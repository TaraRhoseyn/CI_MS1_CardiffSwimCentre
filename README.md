## Project Goals 

The business goals of Cardiff Swim Centre (hereinafter referred to as CSW):

- Increase sales by converting regular customers into monthly members.
- Stress CSW's unique selling point to customers: a pool for serious fitness enthusiasts and not families.
- Increase awareness of the brand as one associated with sports prestige and excellence.
- Build an intuitive UX so users return to the site for key information such as location and pool times.

The user goals:

- Find a premier swimming pool where the priority is training.
- Find a pool timetable that is intuitively built and easy to use. 
- Understand the differences between individual session pricing and membership pricing.
- Find information about facilities at the pool.
- Find out where the pool is located and parking information.

## User Experience

I have designed this website with mobile in mind by creating bite-sized easily digestible pieces of content that can be separated easily. 

I have structured each page according to the information architecture organising principle of placing the most important content 'above the fold', then working my way down in order of priority. 

The user experience is structured around two main goals, (a) to allow the users to discover CSW's location and brand philosophy, and (b) to  convert users into members. Call to actions to these goals are found throughout the website and are given priority through the colour scheme, e.g. more important call to actions are more eye-catching. For example, the navigation bar displays a "Join" button in the top of all pages.

### Target Audience

- Fitness enthusiasts
- Regular swimmers
- Competitive swimmers
- Triathletes
- Teens who participate in swimming clubs and galas
- Parents of above teens

### User Stories

I have divided my user stories into two categories: first-time users and regular visitors, with the understanding that the goal of communicating the brand philosophy and location information will be less of a priority to returning visitors.

#### First-time users

1. As a first time user, I want to know the specifications of the pools so I know it's suited to my needs as a fast or long-distance swimmer.
2. As a first time user, I want to see location information so that I can know where to go to use the pool and plan my journey.
3. As a first time user, I want to see information about classes so that I know I can improve my fitness.
4. As a first time user, I want to ensure their brand values align with my own as a fitness enthusiast.
5. As a first time user, I want to locate their social media accounts so I can receive regular updates from them and see how well known they are in the world of swimming.
6. As a first time user, I want to see a timetable to ensure it works with my own schedules.
7. As a first time user, I want to know the prices of using the pool and membership.

#### Regular visitors

8. As a regular visitor, I want to see a timetable so that I can know which times I can use the pool. 
9. As a regular visitor, I want to see information about classes. 
10. As a regular visitor, I want to understand the pricing model to understand if becoming a member is cost effective. 
11. As a regular visitor, I want to be able to see what the pool offers to see if there are any updates.

#### Site owner 

12. As a site owner, I want customers to be able to join as members in an easy and intuitive way directly on the website.
13. As a site owner, I want customers to be able to access our pool timetable quickly and easily to ensure they can access services at their desired time. 
14. As a site owner, I want prospective customers to be able to contact us with queries or feedback easily. 
15. As a site owner, I want customers to find information about classes in language that is plain and accessible to ensure appropriate use of training.

## Scope 

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features: 

- Navigation bar to let users navigate the website simply, with bolded text and a circle underline to show users which page they are currently on. 
- A footer across all pages with links to social media and other places on the website such as pricing and location. 
- A pool timetable with classes, lane swimming times and closed times. 
- Modal where you can join up as a member in the navigation bar of every page, making joining quick and easy. 
- Pricing page which communicates the benefits of membership clearly and explains costs simply. 
- Contact form where queries can be sent. The form is functional and will not submit unless all fields are filled out. 
- Explanation of training classes, their cost and their benefits to swimmers. 
- An error page (404.html) that directs site users back to the home page (index.html) in the event of a broken URL. 
- An About page which contains company ethos and marketing copy to entice users.
- An About page which contains clear descriptions of all facilities on offer. 
- Embedded map with a location pin to show users how to get to the pool, accompanied by parking information and opening times.
- Favicon icon to help users identify the site.


Features to be built in future releases: 

- Multi-page form to purchase membership and the ability to sign up to monthly direct debit payments. 
- Booking system for training classes. 
- The ability to toggle which days you want to view in the pool timetable on mobile view. 
- A collapsible carousel on the About page on mobile view to switch view between cards.

## Design

My overall approach to the design came from a desire to create a brand that was modern, clean, aesthetically pleasing. From a UX perspective, I also wanted a site that was easily navigable and did not cause cognitive overload. 

The visual language of the website takes it's inspiration from water, much of the components have a fluidity, softness and curviture. 

### Colour Scheme

I have created a contrasting colour scheme of blue and orange with shades of blue being the primary colour. I chose a complementary colour scheme (blue/orange) to be able to draw particular attention to key call to actions. 

I picked blue first, as this gives the user memories and associations of water. It's also a colour often associated with safety and security in marketing/branding.

### Typography

My heading font is Nunito from Google Fonts. I chose this font because:
- The soft and curvy form that goes well with the rest of the visual language
- It's a sans-serif font which is more accessible for people with dyslexia. Sans-serif is the back-up font if Nunito fails. 

My body font is Montserrat. I chose this font because of:
- Wide availability on web browsers. 
- It compliments Nunito well as it's also a largely circular and soft font, but it also contrasts enough with Nunito in terms of font weight to offer a pleasing contrast.

### Imagery

All images on the website are of professional quality and fully licensed. They usually depict swimmers in action to convey a dynamic, lively, and aspirational visual language. Please see 'Credits' section for more information on licenses.

They're striking images that give an energetic feel to the website which stands out particularly well against the white space and modern aesthetic of the overall design.

## Features

The website consists of five pages and 10 features.

### Current Features

#### Feature 1: Home Page

The homepage contains four main sections: 

1. A hero image with a joining call to action.
2. A 'features' section which contains key information such as facilities and member benefits.
3. An 'ethos' section which communicates company values.
4. A location map to help users find the Centre and some parking information. 

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

The copy found in Section 3, like all copy on the website, was written by myself. The map used in Section 4 came from Google Maps. 

**Section 1, the hero image:**

I chose a striking image to evoke feelings of motivation and inspiration in the user. The call to action is highly important in the visual hierarchy of this section. 

![Hero image](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-1-one.PNG)

**Section 2, the features:**

These elements are made from Bootstrap cards. They were originally divs I gave custom height, weight and margin properties to at various screen sizes using media queries, but I realised towards the end of the project it was much easier and cleaner to remake the same elements out of Bootstrap components as they are automatically responsive.

The transition from divs to Bootstrap cards made no stylistic differences as I was able to recreate the look with colours, centering and border radius exactly.

![Features section](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-1-two.PNG)

**Section 3, company ethos:** 

The image layout effect below was made using a custom CSS grid and negative margin values. 

The marketing copy like all others found on the website was written by myself.

![Ethos section](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-1-three.PNG)

**Section 4, location map:** 

The map used was Google Maps.

![Location map](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-1-four.PNG)

**User stories covered by this feature:** 

User story 1: As a first time user, I want to know the specifications of the pools so I know it's suited to my needs as a fast or long-distance swimmer.

User story 2: As a first time user, I want to see location information so that I can know where to go to use the pool and plan my journey.

User story 4: As a first time user, I want to ensure their brand values align with my own as a fitness enthusiast.

User story 11: As a regular visitor, I want to be able to see what the pool offers to see if there are any updates.

#### Feature 2: About Page

The about page has three main sections:

1. Heading 
2. Company history section
3. What we offer section

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

**Section 1, The heading:** 

I learnt how to create the visual effect on this image through a Code Institute lesson. See 'Credits' for more details.

![Heading of About Page](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-one.PNG)

**Section 2, Company history:** 

The layout of this section was achieved through simple Bootstrap row grid. On mobile view the image and marketing copy take up the full width of the screen and are stacked on top of one another. At medium screen size or larger they sit next to each other. 

The image was created using the following steps: 

1. Download image from Unsplash (See 'Credits' for more details).
2. Remove background of image in Adobe Photoshop.
3. Make image monochromatic in Adobe Photoshop. 
4. Create custom shape using the branded cyan colour already established on the rest of the page, and add this as the new background.

![Company values on desktop](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-two-a.PNG)

![Company values on mobile](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-two-b.PNG)

**Section 3, What we offer section:**

This section gives an overview of all that is offered by the Swim Centre, from pool specifications to the cafe to member benefits to training classes. 

The components here are Bootstrap cards. I purposefully chose to have six cards so that on desktop they would display in a row of 3, on tablet 2, and on mobile 1. 

![Offer section on desktop](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-three-a.PNG)

![Offer section on tablet](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-three-b.PNG)

![Offer section on mobile](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-2-three-c.PNG)

**User stories covered by this feature:** 

- User story 1: As a first time user, I want to know the specifications of the pools so I know it's suited to my needs as a fast or long-distance swimmer.
- User story 3: As a first time user, I want to see information about classes so that I know I can improve my fitness.
- User story 4: As a first time user, I want to ensure their brand values align with my own as a fitness enthusiast.
- User story 9: As a regular visitor, I want to see information about classes.
- User story 15: As a site owner, I want customers to find information about classes in language that is plain and accessible to ensure appropriate use of training.

#### Feature 3: Timetable Page

The timetable page gives users all the times the pool will be open for specific activities, such as certain classes or lane swimming times. 

The table was made with the Bootstrap responsive table component, this allows the table to be scrolled horizontally on mobile view, so no information is lost. Originally I had planned to include a drop-down menu on mobile view in which you could pick which day/s you wanted to view at a time, but this was not possible without JavaScript or another external framework. In future releases, more work can be done around optimising this timetable for mobile use. I also included the 'closed' content to ensure the page passed the WAVE accessibility tool with 0 errors, as originally those spaces had been classes as empty rows.

I also included a PDF version of the timetable on the site for users to open and download. I did this as I know from my own experience in a swimming family that many swimmers like to have a copy of the timetable easily at hand at home, for example on a pin board. But I included a QR code on the PDF to encourage users to return to the website too.

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

![Timetable](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-3.PNG)

**User stories covered by this feature:** 

- User story 6: As a first time user, I want to see a timetable to ensure it works with my own schedules.
- User story 8: As a regular visitor, I want to see a timetable so that I can know which times I can use the pool.
- User story 13: As a site owner, I want customers to be able to access our pool timetable quickly and easily to ensure they can access services at their desired time.

#### Feature 4: Pricing Page

The pricing page contains two main sections and is fully responsive on mobile and tablet: 

1. Pricing model section
2. Training classes section

**Section 1, Pricing model section:** 

This section lays out clearly the benefits of joining the Swim Centre as a member, encouraging the conversion. I chose to use the primary bright cyan colour on the 'Member' square to make that the more appealing option. The components were made with Bootstrap cards with custom styling such as box-shadows and colour. 

![Pricing model](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-4-one.PNG)

**Section 2, Training classes section:**

This section gives more information about the specific training classes on offer and what they are intended to be used for. Bootstrap card components were used to make these. This is one of the sections that uses emotive language about motivation heavily. It also includes a call to action to go the timetable page to see when these classes take place. 

![Training classes section](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-4-two.PNG)

**User stories covered by this feature:**

#### Feature 5: Contact Page

The contact page contains a form (please see Feature 10 for specifics about the form) and an accompanying image. 

The image is removed from view on mobile and tablet view as it does not enhance the meaning of the content on the page. 

![Contact page](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-5.PNG)

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

**User stories covered by this feature:** 

- User story 14: As a site owner, I want prospective customers to be able to contact us with queries or feedback easily.

#### Feature 6: 404 Error Page

This page displays when a user enters a URL that does not exist. The main purpose of this page is to let users know that an error has occurred and to redirect them back to the website. The design of this page is simple as I want users to return the main pages of the site as soon as possible upon seeing this page. It consists of a heading, subheading and button.

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

![404 page](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-6.PNG)

While this page does not cover any specific user story, it aids them all by allowing the user to easily navigate themselves back to all of the other features and pages on the site.

#### Feature 7: Navigation Bar

The navigation bar of the website is displayed at the top of the home, about, timetable, pricing, contact and 404 pages. It is based on the Bootstrap navbar component and is responsive. On small devices the navbar collapses and opens with a toggle icon. 

It also contains a call to action 'Join' button that opens a modal (see Feature 9 for more details)

![Navigation bar on desktop view](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-7-one.PNG)

**User stories covered by this feature:** 

- User story 12: As a site owner, I want customers to be able to join as members in an easy and intuitive way directly on the website.

The following user stories are fulfilled by this navigation bar as they relate to speed and clarity in finding pages and information, which is what the navigation bar is there to assist in: 

- User story 7: As a first time user, I want to know the prices of using the pool and membership.
- User story 13: As a site owner, I want customers to be able to access our pool timetable quickly and easily to ensure they can access services at their desired time.
- User story 14: As a site owner, I want prospective customers to be able to contact us with queries or feedback easily.

#### Feature 8: Footer 

The footer is displayed at the bottom of the home, about, pricing, timetable, contact and 404 pages. It contains links to social media, the pricing page, the contact page and the location section of the home page. It has two versions: one for medium and large screen sizes and one for small.

![Footer on desktop view](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS1_CardiffSwimCentre/blob/main/docs/features/feature-8-one.PNG)

The modal is opened when a user clicks on the 'Join' button in the navigation bar or certain call to action buttons on the pricing page and home page. The modal contains a form in which users can sign up to be regular members of the Swim Centre. The modal was made using a Bootstrap component. It is responsive on mobile view.

## Bugs found and resolved during development

- **Bug**: On mobile view all pages had a blank bar of white space to the right of the screen that would trigger a horizontal scrollbar. 
- **Fix**: I discovered this is a common bug with Bootstrap rows. To fix this I set a CSS rule for the root element that the 'overflow-x' be 'hidden'.
- **Bug**: The about page's bottom row cards would overlap with the footer at a certain screen width.
- **Fix**: Lowered the min-width of the media query to include this screen width and increased the bottom-margin of the cards within this query.
- **Bug**: List items being pushed onto the next line was causing inconsistencies across card heights.
- **Fix**: Removed bottom padding on the font awesome tick icon.
- **Bug**: Buttons were not passing WAVE accessibility standards due to colour contrast failures. 
- **Fix**: Set the colour property of all anchor elements to black. 
- **Bug**: The about page's row of three cards would overlap into each other on tablet view. 
- **Fix**: Eeplaced the col-md-4 class with col-md-6 and col-lg-4 classes, and put them into one row over two.
- **Bug**: Page loading speed was slow. I could not get the performance metric in Google lighthouse above 74% for all pages. 
- **Fix**: Optimised the PNG images by making the file sizes smaller, then converted all PNGs to WEBP. 
- **Bug**: Modal button not opening the modal. 
- **Fix**: Added 'bs' classes to 'data-bs-toggle' and 'data-bs-target'. Realised mistake by re-reading Bootstrap [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/) more closely. 
- **Bug**: Footer list items which contained social media icons were classed as empty list items by WAVE accessibility tool. 
- **Fix**: Added aria-hidden attribute with the value of 'true' to the iframe element within the list item, and added a class of 'sr-only' to the span containing the text version of the icon. 
- **Bug**: Submit and reset buttons on modal were classes as empty by WAVE accessibility tool. 
- **Fix**: Added values of 'submit' and 'reset' to prospective buttons. 
- **Bug**: All headings produced contrast errors by WAVE accessibility tool. 
- **Fix**: Added linear-background to background-image of heading divs.
- **Bug**: Form on contact page was not submitting properly. 
- **Fix**: The IDs were incorrectly typed (duplicate IDs to modal form and incorrect on corresponding labels). I realised the mistake due to HTML validation errors and changed accordingly.
